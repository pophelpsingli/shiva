To use TeamSpeak 3, you need two things: a client and a server. The client is the software that you install on your PC, Mac, or smartphone. The server is the software that runs on a host computer and allows multiple clients to connect and communicate.
 
You can download the TeamSpeak 3 client for free from the official website. However, if you want to run your own server, you need a license. There are different types of licenses available for TeamSpeak 3, depending on your needs and preferences.
 
## Free Server License
 
If you only need a small server for up to 32 concurrent users, you can get a free server license from TeamSpeak. This license allows you to run one virtual server on your own hardware. You can download the server software from the official website and follow the installation instructions. You will need to agree to the terms and conditions of the free license and provide some basic information about yourself and your server.
 
A free server license is ideal for most clans, guilds, and non-commercial organizations that want to have their own private voice chat. However, if you need more slots or virtual servers, you will need to upgrade to a paid license.
 
## Gamer License
 
If you want more flexibility and control over your server, you can purchase a gamer license from TeamSpeak. This license allows you to run up to two virtual servers with up to 1024 slots on your own hardware. You can choose from different pricing plans depending on how many slots you need. The annual renewal cost ranges from $55 for 64 slots to $500 for 1024 slots.

## Commercial License
 
If you are a company or a business that needs an internal voice communication solution, you can request a commercial license from TeamSpeak. This license allows you to run unlimited virtual servers with unlimited slots on your own hardware. You can use TeamSpeak 3 for your employees, customers, partners, or affiliates.
 
A commercial license is not for reselling TeamSpeak servers or becoming an authorized TeamSpeak host provider (ATHP). If you want to do that, you will need a different license. You will also need to contact TeamSpeak directly for more information about the pricing and terms of the commercial license.
 
## Conclusion
 
TeamSpeak 3 is a great way to communicate with others online. Whether you want to chat with your friends, play games with your teammates, or collaborate with your colleagues, you can find a suitable license for your server. You can get a free server license for up to 32 users, a gamer license for up to 1024 users, or a commercial license for unlimited users.
 
To get started, you just need to download the client and the server software from the official website and register for a license. Then you can enjoy the benefits of having your own TeamSpeak 3 server.
